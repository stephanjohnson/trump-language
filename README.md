# Trump!

If you've ever felt like a politician just banging away at a keyboard, then Trump! will make you feel right at home. 
It's a language designed primarily for politicians, specifically the republican. With Trump! you only use three syntax elements:
 - Trump.
 - Trump?
 - Trump!

## Here are a few examples of Trump! in action:

```
Trump. Trump?
Move the Memory Pointer to the next array cell.
```
``` 
Trump? Trump.
Move the Memory Pointer to the previous array cell.
```
``` 
Trump. Trump.
Increment the array cell pointed at by the Memory Pointer.
```
```
Trump! Trump!
Decrement the array cell pointed at by the Memory Pointer.
```
```
Trump. Trump!
Read a character from STDIN and put its ASCII value into the cell pointed 
```
